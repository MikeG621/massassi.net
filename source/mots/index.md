title: Mysteries of the Sith (MotS) Info &amp; Cheats
body:

[TOC]

## Introduction

Mysteries of the Sith is an addon for Jedi
Knight. Previously, it could be purchased seperately, but now, it's
a lot more common to find it packaged with Jedi Knight.

## New Features

MotS is actually more than an addon pack.
Lucasarts actually upgraded the engine to include more features.
The most notable is the new colored lighting (which can only be
seen with a decent 3d card). They tweaked the saber some, added a
whole slew of new missions, both single player and multiplayer. In
SP, you play Mara Jade, a female character that was made popular by
the trilogy of Star Wars novels by Timothy Zahn.

MotS was met with mixed reviews. Basically, the
new engine features are welcome, but the level design and new
weapons just weren't up to par with the original. This is made up
for, however, in the sheer amount and quality of multiplayer maps -
it seems like they concentrated a lot more on the multiplayer
aspects. They've even included a new MP mode, KFY, which is
explained in detail in the instruction manual.

## Addon Levels

As with Jedi Knight, people can make addon
levels for Mysteries of the Sith. All released editors have
Mysteries of the Sith support, and the process is basically the
same.

## Editing Information

Most of our Jedi Knight tutorials apply to MotS as well.
Really the only things different are the colored lighting (we have
a tutorial on that) and a few cog verbs.
