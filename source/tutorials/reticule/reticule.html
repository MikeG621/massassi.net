<b><font size=+1>Making/Using the Target Reticule</font></b>
<br><b>By <a href="mailto:Dragons_bane@hotmail.com">Obsidian</a></b>
<br>
<p>This tutorial isn't meant for the new coggers...
You have to have an understanding of how cog works and some knowledge of
where files go in the resource directory.&nbsp; I'm going to assume you
know what goes where in this tutorial.
<p>The targeting reticule is mainly used in force
powers (blinding, grip, pull, ect.) and tells the player who/what they
have targeted.&nbsp; It has no effect other then that, as the force power's
cog already knows what's targeted and what's not.
<p>I reviewed many ways to write this tutorial, and
I concluded that displaying the cog I made and giving detailed comments
would be the best route, as (how i first started writing this tutorial)
doing it step by step takes a long time, and is quite confusing (not only
when writing it, but reading one as long as this one would have to be would
be no walk in the park either).
<p>There are 3 commands (there may be more, but you
only need 3) specifically used for the target reticule.
<p>JkSetTargetColor(color1, color2, color3);
<br>JkSetTarget(Thing);
<br>JkEndTarget();
<p>JkSetTargetColor sets the colors of the 3 'bouncing'
circles.&nbsp; Color1 is the color of the 1st circle, color 2 is the color
of the 2nd circle, and color 3 is the color of the 3rd circle.
<p>JkSetTarget sets the bouncing circles on the specified
thing.&nbsp; Only one thing can be targeted in this manner at a time.
<p>JkEndTarget removes the circles from whatever
they were set to by JkSetTarget.
<p>Below is the cog i wrote for this tutorial, it
is also (should be anyway) available in the zip.&nbsp; It replaces force
pull.

<p>That is the bare bones necessary for using the
target reticule as it is used in the force powers.&nbsp; By changing the
flags on FirstThingInView (thing type flags) you can make it select other
things besides players/actors (such as in force pull).

<p>Good luck and happy editing,
