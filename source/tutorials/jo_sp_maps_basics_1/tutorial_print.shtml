<p><i>Thanks to AKPiggott for showing this</i></p>

<p>First you're going to create a project folder within the <i>jedioucast/gamedata/</i> directory. Once that is done, go into your project folder and create a new text file. Name it <i>gamestart.cfg</i> and then open it up in Wordpad. All you need to type in there is the following</p>

<font size="3" color="silver">
<pre>// This will tell JO to load your map. 

map        nameofyourmap       
</pre></font>


<p>Now you need to go in extract ui/<i>newgame.menu</i> from <i>assets1.pk3</i> to your project folder and open it up in Wordpad. Go down and find the following line:</p>

<font size="3" color="silver">
<pre>uiScript        startgame
</pre></font>

<p>Delete it and replace it with this line:</p>

<font size="3" color="silver">
<pre>exec        "exec gamestart.cfg" 
</pre></font>

<p>Now create a new .pk3 file with this modified file in under the "ui" folder. Make sure this .pk3 file is saved under your mod directory.</p>

<p>Now start up Jedi Outcast in Single Player mode. Go to <i>Options</i>, then to <i>Mods</i>. If you have the patched version of the game, your mod directory name should appear in the mod list (If you don't, then download the new JO patches (http://support.lucasarts.com/patches/patches.htm) and update your game!). Click on your mod and click <i>Load Mod</i>.</p>

<p>It doesn't get much easier than this, but some people might not notice just how easy it is and search for a way to do this through scripts and such.</p>

<p>Simply load up your Radiant editor and create a <i>player_start_info</i> entity where you want your player to start. Then select it and open up the Entity Properties window (Press the <b>N</b> key).</p>

<p>Now go down to the <i>Key</i> and <i>Value</i> boxes and enter the following:</p>

<font size="3" color="silver">
<pre>
// This will give your entity a name so you can target it
Key                spawnflags 
Value             32   
</pre></font>

<p>Alternatively, you can simply check the <i>Stun_Baton</i> box, which spawns the player with a Stun Baton and a Bryar Pistol by default. Not too difficult, huh?</p>

<p><font size="4">Changing the Single-Player hero's model</font></p>

<p>Unfortunately, right now there is no real professional way of changing the Single-Player model from Kyle to something else, so this is more of a workaround.</p>

<p>First you're going to create a project folder within <i>jedioucast/gamedata/</i>. Take whichever model you want to use, then copy its files into your project folder under:</p>

<p><i>projectfolder/models/players/modelname/</i></p>

<p>If the model has a shader file that comes with (eg., the custom Wookie model has a shader that will render his hair textures transparent so they look right) Simply take that shader file and put it in your project folder under:</p>

<p><i>projectfolder/shaders/</i></p>

<p>Now rename your <i>modelname/</i> folder to <i>kyle/</i> and load up the .skin files that come with the model (<i>model_default.skin</i>) and change the path for each of the textures that lead to the model's folder name.</p>

<blockquote><b>For example:</b><br>
If you have the line :<br>
<br>
<i>head,models/players/<b>han_anh</b>/face.tga</i><br>
<br>
change it to:<br>
<i>head,models/players/<b>kyle</b>/face.tga </i><br>
</blockquote>

<p><b>Do not</b> change lines that point to caps.tga textures (they are in the stormtroopers folder)<br>
<i>eg. r_arm_cap_r_hand_off,models/players/stormtrooper/caps.tga</i></p>

<p>Now create a new .pk3 file with these modified files in their respective folders (<i>models/players/kyle/ , shaders/</i>). Make sure this .pk3 file is saved under your mod directory.</p>

<p>Now start up Jedi Outcast in Single Player mode. Go to <i>Options</i>, then to <i>Mods</i>. If you have the patched version of the game, your mod directory name should appear in the mod list (If you don't, then download the new JO patches (http://support.lucasarts.com/patches/patches.htm) and update your game!). Click on your mod and click <i>Load Mod</i>.</p>

<p>Well this is pretty much it for these tutorials. Remember, you don't need to pack each different modification into separate .pk3 files. You can simply pack it all into one .pk3 file. Just make sure each file is stored in its respective folder.</p>

<p>Feel free to contact me if you need help getting any of this to work, or post a topic at the Massassi Forums (http://forums.massassi.net) in the Jedi Outcast Editing Forum.</p>
