I can't stress enough how important it is for a level to have a large amount
of detail.  It helps to make it more realistic, and just outright more interesting.  One
of the things I have used in the past are beams, support structures.  This
tutorial addresses beams, but you can also apply this to adding door frames, 
window frames, supports for catwalks, and many, many other things.
<BR><BR>
That said, let's get started.  The first thing I would suggest is switching
your map grid settings and snap to settings to 0.1.  This will help in being
able to cleave more complex structures.  Once you are finished learning how,
you can always decrease the grid snap, to create even smaller details.

<ol>
<li> Okay, the first thing I would do is create the sector in which you want to 
be the inside of your structure.  In this tutorial, I am going to use the default
sector.  I would suggest counting the number of grid spaces so you can cleave
the correct number of beams.  For example, if you are just creating beams in
the inside of a room, you'd want the beams to start in each corner, but if you
have an even number of grid spaces, you will end up with a beam in one corner,
but then it wouldn't work out to be in the other corner as well.  It's not
important right now, but you'll see what I am talking about as this tutorial
progresses.
<BR><BR>
<li> Okay, the first thing to do is switch to the side view ([shift+2]), and
cleave the sector edges to create the width
of the beams.  Below, I have cleaved the sector along one side, and the small
remaining sector will be the width of my beams.
<BR><BR>

<BR><BR>
<li> Now do the same with the other side.
<BR><BR>
<CENTER><img src="2.GIF"></CENTER>
<BR><BR>
<li> Now you have the two sides, but you have to remember that beams go along
the top of a structure also.  So, making sure the center sector is selected,
cleave the top as shown below.
<BR><BR>
<CENTER><img src="3.GIF"></CENTER>
<BR><BR>
<li> Okay, now to start cleaving the beams.  Make sure one of the side sectors
is selected, and switch to the other side view, [shift+3].
<BR><BR>
<li> Now, cleave that sector in the shape of vertical beams.  As you cleave,
I would suggest switching back and forth in all the views to make sure you 
are cleaving the correct sector.
<BR><BR>
<CENTER><img src="4.GIF"></CENTER>
<BR><BR>
<center>This is the view from an angle, for clarity.</center>
<CENTER><img src="5.GIF"></CENTER>
<BR><BR>
<li> Okay, now to actually make them show up.  As of now, all the beam cleaves
are adjoined, so they don't show up.  The easiest way to make them show up is
to delete every other beam.  Start at one side, and select every other beam,
and delete it.
<BR><BR>
<CENTER><img src="6.GIF"></CENTER>
<BR><BR>
<li> Now, if you go to the 3D preview, you will be able to see the beams.
I have textured them below briefly for clarity.
<BR><BR>
<CENTER><img src="7.GIF"></CENTER>
<BR><BR>
<li> Now, it's time to repeat the cleaves and deletes with the other side
and with the top.  First, making sure the other side is selected, cleave it
just as you did the first side.  When you start deleting, make sure you
delete the sectors that are directly opposite the ones you deleted originally.
If you don't, they will be offset.
<BR><BR>
<CENTER><img src="8.GIF"></CENTER>
<BR><BR>
<li> Okay, now for the top.  Making sure the top sector is selected, cleave
just like you did on the sides, and delete the ones that are in line with the 
ones you deleted for the sides.
</ol>
<BR><BR>
After you finish all that, you can texture, and you're done!
<BR><BR>
<b>Some final notes:</b>  Make sure to be careful where you use this technique.  As
you can see, it creates a lot of sectors.  If you have too huge of a room,
it could end up with a bad framerate for some people.
