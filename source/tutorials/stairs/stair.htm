<p align="center"><font size="4" face="Arial"><strong>Part 1 :
Intro</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial">So, you want some stairs? Good
Decision! Stairs add a professional touch that, unfortunately,
not many custom levels released have. First of all , lets explore
what stairways can replace: </font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial">Ramps &#150; Who wants a ramp when
you can make a nicer looking and just as effective staircase ?</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial">Elevators &#150; Some levels are
filled with elevators that stairs can replace. The stairs will
reduce lag, therefore increasing playability.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial">Now, lets take a look at some
levels with nice examples of stairways. If you have MOTS, load up
the Hutt&#146;s Palace MP level. It is filled with many
differently shaped stairways. Also take note of the spiral
stairway leading to the basement, this is the toughest of
stairways to make and will be covered in a future tutor. Some JK
examples of stairs are in the singleplayer level : Warzone
Chapter 1. There are two stairways, one of them is a simple
spiral one. Now , lets load up JED or FB and get to work!</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="4" face="Arial"><strong>Part 2:
Basic Stairway</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial"><strong>Step One:</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial">Create a new JK or MOTS level.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial">Cleave the starting box in half
horizontally in the overhead view. You will now have two
rectangular sectors. Switch to side mode (keyboard button 3) and
select the sector on the right side. Align its bottom left vertex
with the grid (switch to vertex mode, select the bottom right
vertex, and hit [shift+s]) and cleave it up two dots on the
default grid. We are now set up to cleave the stairs in. Make
sure you have this on your screen before proceeding:</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial"><strong>Step Two:</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial">Next we need to align the bottom
right vertex with the grid, and set the grid to snap in small
increments ( I like every .04 ) Okay, we are all set to begin the
process. Make sure to save your work before continuing. </font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial">Ready? Cleave horizontally across
ONE STEP below the vertex we just aligned with. This creates a
triagle shaped sector. Align the grid with the bottom left vertex
of the triangle and cleave vertically down from that point. Then
cleave horizontally again towards the left. Another triangle
sector is created. Align the bottom left vertex with the grid
once again, and continue the process until you reach the bottom
of the sector. This is what it should look like now:</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial"><img src="step2.gif" width="420"
height="175"></font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial">Okay, we have cleaved up our what
was once a one sector rectangle into a mess of sectors. Now it is
time to delete all those extra sectors. So lets get to work.
Delete every one of the rectangular sectors created when you
cleaved vertically. </font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial">Presto! Your first staircase.
Texture it up and try it out in JK/MOTS. It is completely smooth!
No choppy effects when walking on it! </font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p align="center"><font size="4" face="Arial"><strong>Part 3:
Advanced Stairs</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial">Okay. You have the stairway
concept mastered and you want to continue, eh? What we will cover
here is how to create &#145;floating&#146; stair ways ( ones that
can be walked underneath of ). An example of floating stairs Is
the stairwell in Warzone 1 or the stairwell in Hutt&#146;s
Palace. In my opinion floating stairways look much better in some
circumstances. Lets get to work.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial"><strong>Part one:</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial">Load up Jed, and in the overhead
view, cleave a line .4 units to the right of the left edge. Then
switch to view 3 and align the grid with the bottom left vertex
and cleave diagonally up 2 dots. With the rotated view, you
should have this: </font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial"><img src="step4.gif" width="320"
height="300"></font></p>

<p><br>
</p>

<p align="center"><font size="4"><strong>Method 1</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial">Okay, now lets cleave the stairway
up just like we did in part one. But instead of deleting the
entire lower sectors, lets cleave them again horizontally to
leave a small rectangle. This is very hard to describe in text,
so just look at the pic:</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial"><img src="step5.gif" width="410"
height="160"></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="4" face="Arial"><strong>Method 2</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial">As you see, you need to align
every vertex before you cleave each sector.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial">If you would like to make stairs
without steps underneath (I.E, a smooth surface) , simply cleave
upwards from the bottom left recangle on it's vertex until you
reach the top right rectangle sector. I know this is confusing,
so I included a picture...</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial"><img src="step7.gif" width="405"
height="220"></font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial">Finally, delete the smaller
sectors, creating steps, but leave the larger ones to act as the
space to walk under. If you are using method two, you may merge
all the large sectors becuase they will form a convex shape. <strong>Do
this with caution!</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial">Texture up the area and it should
look something like this:</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial"><img src="step6.gif" width="380"
height="300"></font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial">Excuse the tacky textures, but
they provide the best way to see the different sides of the
stairs. :-)</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial">Take note that Kyle has plenty of
room to walk under&#133;.</font></p>
