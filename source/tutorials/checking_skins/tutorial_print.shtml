<p>Lately I've noticed several pallet problems in Jedi Knight Skin. What does a pallet Problem do? Check out these Leia's:</p>

<p>Notice how her dress shade changes. This is because each Color Map changes a select few colors in its palette (someday I'll make a list of these and send it in). In the most drastic case (a level with a dflt.cmp) these colors that change would be neon pink (Ouch!). That's why it's a good idea to check for these.</p>

<ol>
 <p><li> Open JED
 
 <p><li> Hit File -> Save As and Save it (as <b>Untitled.JED</b>) to the directory with all you mats.</p>
 
<CENTER><IMG SRC="save.jpg"></CENTER>

 <p><li> Click the Surface button (<IMG SRC="surface.jpg" align="absmiddle">) on the top menu bar.

 <p><li> Click Tools -> Item Editor<BR>

 <p><li> Double Click +MATERIAL</p>
 
<CENTER><IMG SRC="material.jpg"></CENTER>

 <p><li> Click on Project Directory (upper left hand) and scroll down your mat list. If you see something like this in your lower left hand side: <IMG SRC="baddash.jpg"> you have a problem :-)<BR>

That is what your lovely skin would look like in a level with the dflt.com -- see why we fix that?<BR>

 <p><li> Just re-edit your mat -- trying to get rid of the bad color. And then repeat the checking process.<BR>

</ol>

Happy Hunting :-) I'll get the pallet done if I have a free day (and I'll send it to Massassi)<BR>
