<b><font size=+2>Client/Server Cog Tutorial</font></b>
<br><font size=-1>By <a href="mailto:dragons_bane@hotmail.com">Obsidian</a></font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p>This tutorial is most definitely not meant for the beginning coggers.&nbsp;
It deals with some advanced stuff, meant to keep the lag down during Multiplayer
games.&nbsp; You should know how to use triggers well, as c/s cogs depend
on them heavily.
<p>Why client/server cogs you ask?&nbsp; The reason is very simple:&nbsp;
JK/MotS is laggy enough as it is, there is no need to add any more lag
then necessary because a door or a window was not 'optimized' for MP games.&nbsp;
A good way to think of it is to think of an actual network (at school,
work, or even a LAN in your home).&nbsp; I'll use a school network as an
example.&nbsp; Lets say you sit at a computer in the library and feel like
surfing the net, so you double click on the Netscape icon.&nbsp; Now, 1
of 2 things could happen.&nbsp; Lets say all the files and programs are
on the file server (i.e. all the cogs are run off of the host's computer)
and the computer your at needs to access and run Netscape from the server.&nbsp;
Every action you make in Netscape (whether you are even connected to the
internet or not) is sent over the network and back.&nbsp; It doesn't take
a guineas to figure out that that will create an awful lot of lag on the
network.&nbsp; Same is true with cogs.&nbsp; If you have to access a cog
that is on the host computer only, each time it is used it will create
an abundance of lag.&nbsp; Now, lets say that school installs Netscape
onto the computer you are sitting at.&nbsp; You fire up Netscape, and it
pops up almost immediately due to the fact that your computer didn't have
to receive it over the network from the server, and you go chugging along
browsing your pages.&nbsp; The server sends you the minimal amount of information
needed to view the page and its contents, and Netscape deciphers it locally
and displays it.&nbsp; This is very true with c/s cogs.&nbsp; You walk
up to a c/s door and try to open it.&nbsp; It fires off a trigger telling
the server that this door is going to open, and if the server ok's it,
it will fire off another trigger telling ALL the clients to open that door
locally.
<p>There are inherent dangers when using c/s cogs though.&nbsp; One of
the predominant issues is syncing the thing/s (in our case a door).&nbsp;
For example, little Joey is playing on a JK game that little Billy is hosting.&nbsp;
Billy opens a c/s door, and the network packet heading to Joey, that contains
the trigger telling his door to open, gets dropped.&nbsp; Now, we end up
with Billy having an open door and Joey having a closed door.&nbsp; Because
Billy's door doesn't give a rip what Joey's door is doing, Billy is able
to walk through his open door.&nbsp; Meanwhile, it appears to Joey that
Billy just walked through a door (or it may appear that Billy is place
walking into the door, which would cause horrendous syncing problems with
the players as well as the doors), and is unable to follow because his
door is closed.&nbsp; Or, Billy turns around and starts to shoot Joey.&nbsp;
To Billy, the projectiles hit Joey.&nbsp; To Joey the projectiles hit his
door, which isn't open, and does no damage.&nbsp; This could lead into
rampit accusations of cheating, and possibly a boot or two.&nbsp;&nbsp;
You could, however, use a system of triggers to keep all the doors synced
on all machines, but that would use a lot of triggers, and defeat the purpose
of using c/s cogs all together, and that would just be silly.
<p>"But Obsidian, What good are c/s cogs then if they can mess up like
that?!"
<p>The answer is simple young grasshopper.. You need to use some innovation,
a little luck, and a lot of skill.&nbsp; Think of a way that is bandwidth
effective, yet still has a low chance of messing up under normal to moderately
heavy usage.&nbsp; For example, don't code an idiot proof door that will
resist messing up if constantly used over and over and over on multiple
clients.&nbsp; It will take a lot of time, bandwidth, and the results will
not be worth the extra bandwidth expended to keep it idiot proof.&nbsp;
The best, though, would be idiot proof AND bandwidth effective.
<p>Another danger with c/s programs/cogs/whatever is the ease in which
they can be hacked.&nbsp; Diablo and Interstate '76 come to mind.&nbsp;
Whenever information is used on the client side only (i.e. the server keeps
its paws off of it until the client sends it) there is a tremendous possibility
of hacking.&nbsp; That is also why massively multiplayer games, such as
Utlima Online and EverQuest, give the server absolute rule over everything.&nbsp;
Character information, item information, and world information are all
saved on the server to prevent client side hacking of characters and items.&nbsp;
However, as seen with UO Extreme, even this method is not hacker proof.&nbsp;
Hacking is not a concern you will need to deal with when writing a c/s
cog, because the information we're going to handle on the client side isn't
even worth trying to hack.
<p>Below are the simple cogs i made to demonstrate Client/Server coding.
<p>If you are bright enough, you will see that my cogs actually create
about 2x as much lag as necessary.&nbsp; The client cog (when activated)
will send a trigger to the server cog.&nbsp; Upon the receiving of the
trigger, the server cog will broadcast another trigger to all the clients
telling them to move the thing to the other frame.&nbsp; I very well could
have made the client cog broadcast the trigger that moves the thing to
the other frame, which would reduce the lag it makes by about 1/2, but
this way gives you a spot to sort of 'moderate' what is going on.&nbsp;
You could cancel the thing moving, check to see if a certain player activated
his thing, check to see if the player who activated the thing had a key
(or other item required) to move the thing, all kinds of stuff which would
otherwise be a pain in the ass to do within the door cog itself,&nbsp;
and that may very well require you to send more then one trigger.. which
would defeat the whole short cut idea and be an awful lot more messy.
<p>As an example, lets say you restructure an entire door cog to c/s to
cut out the middle server cog.&nbsp; Then your level editor comes to you
and says "on second thought, I want to use this door cog insted".&nbsp;
If you hadn't done the entire c/s operation in the door cog, all you would
need to do is slap some triggers into the new door cog and shuffle the
code around a bit to activate the door by triggers.. as opposed to having
to either a) restructure the new door cog so it will be a stand-alone c/s
cog, or b) shoot the level editor and use the door cog you spent hours
restructuring.
<p>Again, I feel It would be of more benefit to display the cogs I did
and give detailed comments, as opposed to walking you through a step-by-step
process which can get awfully confusing and tedious (too bad level tutorial
authors don't have this luxury ;) )

to do anything besides redirect the client trigger)&nbsp; My comments are

<br>&nbsp;
<p>Now, to maybe clear up a little confusion, the above cogs will move
the SAME object on all players' machines, making it appear as if it is
done globally, only with a fraction of the lag.&nbsp; I think i heard somewhere
that a trigger is only a few bytes in size, and when considering only 2
triggers (1 if you didn't activate the thing) were sent to/from you, with
a grand total of a few bytes of information being sent over the network.
Client/server cogs are a work from the heavens.. if done properly.&nbsp;
Glass would also benefit greatly from a c/s makeover.
<br>The only thing i really see that cannot be effectively converted to
c/s are elevators, and more generally anything that is designed to move
players.&nbsp; These types of c/s cogs can create nasty player syncing
problems, because the player won't be in the same spot on all machines,
and that spells disaster.&nbsp;&nbsp; So there are some cogs that need
to stay global for syncing reasons.. But barring those, the sky's the limit
=).
