One of the best features of the Jedi Knight series of games is the fact that they contain
"cutscenes" when you finish either a level or certain objectives. These are like
mini-movies which help with the flow of the story being told by the game.
The cutscenes in Jedi Knight were pre-recorded video which is then saved to the CD in
a special format and then played back.
<p>
With the Mysteries of the Sith add-on pack, the cutscenes changed from video to being
"acted" out by the graphics engine of the game itself. These cutscenes were also recorded
to the CD (as .san files) but were created using the game engine and COGs. This tutorial
shows you how to achieve the same effects by writing your own COGs to control Actors and
the camera(s). You'll need some COG experience, which you can get from other tutorials, but
I'll explain everything as best I can so hopefully you won't need too much experience
to understand it!
<p>
Cutscenes make a nice addition to any SP level. They give a professional feel and are
easy to write. At least you don't have to hire (and pay) actors! The best way to implement
any cutscenes is to have a story. Use the cutscenes to enforce the story and give your
player a break from the action. It's nice to see a quick intro to a level (How did Kyle/Mara
get there? Why are they there?) and also to wrap up the ending to the story.
<p>
Now you have some idea about what you want to see in your cutscenes, we'll discuss how
you go about implementing your ideas. We all know from using Security Cameras in levels
that you can view your level from a different object - this is the basis for our "camera".
A camera is only a "thing" which can have frames and can therefore be moved around. Now
we have a panning, tilting and moving camera!
<p>
Our actors are just that - Actor Things. We can create things that use any template and that
includes Kyle, Mara, StormTroopers, Darth Vader and so on. Each Actor has commands which
can be used to get it to do things - move to positions, look in certain places and even
fire their weapons or die. In fact, anything in the game can be done with the right COG
commands.
<p>
One thing that we cannot do however, is control the Player object. We must therefore be a
bit sneaky and replace the Player object with an exact copy which is really an Actor object
instead. We then hide the Player object by making it invisible! That way, we control the
Actor, don't worry about the player and you just see the cutscene!
<p>
<h2>Setting the Stage</h2>
The first thing that we need to do for our cutscene is to create a stage for our actors
to work with. This is simply part of the level where we can create our Actors, move them
around, play out the cutscene and then pass control back to the game and the player.
This area doesn't have to be part of the actual level; you can create it seperately from
the main level in a bit of space that you have spare. This works best for levels where
the action takes place inside something, such as a Bulk Cruiser, but we want the cutscene
to show some action outside, such Pirate Fighters attacking it. Just create a large cube
in the corner of your level somewhere, dress the inside with the ships and stars and viola!
One make-shift studio!
<p>
<h2>Implementing our COGs</h2>
I assume that you know how and when COGs can be called, such as entering sectors, touching
surfaces, activating objects and so on. We can also use the Master COG to produce a small
intro cutscenes when our level starts. Maybe Kyle has just landed and discovers the
hidden entrance to an Imperial Base in a mountain. You get the idea! Assuming that we
have an area in our level for our Actors to "work" in, we can create our Startup COG
to start playing our cutscene. You can edit the startup COG directly or call another COG
from within. I'll leave that up to you as it depends on your COGging ability!
<p>
<h2>Camera Implementation</h2>
We know that viewing the cutscene as Kyle/Mara isn't going to very exciting, so we need to
create one or more external cameras. We simply place "ghost" objects, as these don't appear in
the game and are invisible, into our level. Change the <i>Roll, Pitch and Yaw</i> of the
camera to get it pointing in the right direction. This is a bit hit-and-miss, so you'll
have to give it a try and keep testing until you get it right. Just a few attempts will
give you the feel for it.
<p>
Using frames in our camera things allows us to setup positions where we want the camera
to move between. We then simply use our COG to move the camera around between the frames.
Before we do that, we first want to switch the view to our camera object. This is done
with this little bit of code:
<p><UL>
<FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF"><PRE>
    // switch to camera view
    SetCameraFocus(0, CameraThing);
</PRE></FONT></UL>
<p>
The first parameter, a <FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">0</FONT> in this case is always used as a zero. This defines "internal"
view, just like the internal view for Kyle. As other objects don't have external views,
always make sure this parameter is zero!
<p>
The <FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">CameraThing</FONT> object has been defined as a Thing
and assigned to our Ghost object we want to use as a camera. When this piece of code is
now called, we see the view from that Object.
<p>
Use this code to switch between any number of cameras you have defined in your COG.
<p>
We also need to know how to set the view back to the player. This is done using the code:
<p><UL>
<FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF"><PRE>
    // switch to player view
    SetCameraFocus(0, jkGetLocalPlayer());
</PRE></FONT></UL>
<p>
This just switches the camera back to the internal view for the player. Simple!
<p>
<h2>Introducing the Grip</h2>
Ever wondered what the "Grip" is in a film's credits? Apparently it's the poor person who
has to pull the cart with the camera attached when they film a moving shot. This is
what we are now going to look at - moving our camera.
<p>
Moving any object can be done with frames. A frame is a definition of an object in a
certain position. Most objects don't have frames because they don't need to move. If you've
ever created a door in your level, you'll know about how frames work. You define a series
of frames for an object, a bit like a "dot-to-dot" puzzle. When you use the COG to move
the object to the next frame, or "dot", the game engine fills in between the frames,
moving it along the "line". This allows us to create complicated paths for our camera which
it can move along.
<p>
Getting the camera to move between frames is a doddle:
<p><UL>
<FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF"><PRE>
    // move camera between frames
    MoveToFrame(CameraThing, 1, speed);
    MoveToFrame(CameraThing, 2, speed);
    MoveToFrame(CameraThing, 3, speed);
</PRE></FONT></UL>
<p>
No! That's too easy! Yes, it really is <b>that</b> easy to move a camera around.
You don't need to implement any sort of delays in between moving the frames as the
game engine will wait until the camera has finished moving before setting it off
to the next frame.
<p>
In case you didn't guess it, <FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">CameraThing</FONT> is our Ghost object
we're using as a camera. The number, <FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">1</FONT>,
<FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">2</FONT>, <FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">3</FONT> etc is the number
of the frame you want the object to move to. The last number (a float) is
<FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">Speed</FONT> which is just that - the speed the object moves.
<p>
Because our ghost "camera" object is just another object, we can use this technique to
move <b>any</b> object around, including the models of ships.
<p>
<h2>Emotions Dahling, Emotions...</h2>
Now we need to look at how we create, move and animate our Actors.
Remember I said earlier about cheating with the Player by replacing it with an Actor?
This is how you do it:
<p><UL>
<FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF"><PRE>
thing      player                    local
thing      kyle                      local
template   gunless=KyleBryarActor    local

[...]

    // setup first
    player = GetLocalPlayerThing();
    jkBeginCutscene();

    // switch the player for an Actor
    SetActorFlags(player, 0xa00000);
    StopThing(player);
    Kyle = CreateThing(gunless, player);
    StopThing(Kyle);
    SetThingCurGeoMode(player, 0);

</PRE></FONT></UL>
<p>
You'll notice I've introduced a few extras in there. The first bit gets the handle for
our player. The next line, <FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">jkBeginCutscene();</FONT> tells the
game engine that we are acting out a cutscene and that the user <b>must</b> sit and
watch it. It stops them pressing "Escape" to get out to the setup screens.
<p>
The <FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">SetActorFlags(player, 0xa00000);</FONT> makes the player
object (that we setup earlier) unable to respond to the player's interactions. This stops
them running around, shooting or whatever when we're trying to do our cutscene!
<p>
We also use <FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">StopThing(player);</FONT> as this stops the player
dead in their tracks. If you don't have this line, it's possible to move the mouse and
when the <FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">SetActorFlags()</FONT> line is executed, the player can
spin on the spot! Looks kinda funny!
<p>
The next lines are where we do our swapping. We setup an object (called
<FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">Kyle</FONT>) to be a new object that we create using the template
defined for <FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">gunless</FONT>, at the position of <FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">player</FONT>.
This will create an exact replica of Kyle where the player is standing. At this point,
we haven't yet switched to our camera view so you can't see it.
<p>
We also want to make sure that our new Kyle actor isn't doing anything, so we use the
<FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">StopThing()</FONT> command again.
<p>
Finally, we make our player "invisible" by using the <FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">SetThingCurGeoMode()</FONT>
to set their Geo Mode to zero, which is "not drawn".
<p>
We are now free to use our camera code to switch to an external view and watch the action!
<p>
Using the same code to create Actors at points, using different templates such as the
StormTrooper or Darth Vader, we can create more Actors in our scene. If the scene is
in an area the player cannot get to, the Actors can always be predefined, ready and waiting
for the words <b>"Action!"</b>.
<p>
<h2>What's my motivation for this scene...?</h2>
Now we have all our actors, scenery and the like ready and waiting, we just need to animate
the Actors. There are many commands you can use to do this. A good reference is at the
<a href="http://www.jedinights.com/massassi/specs/jkspecs.htm" target ="_top">JK Specs</A>
pages under the Actors section in "COGs".
<p>
Another good place to check on how LucasArts did their cutscenes is by looking in the
<FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">CutScenes.zip</FONT> file which is on your MotS CD. This has all
the COGs used to create all the cutscenes from the game. It's interesting to look through
these and see some of the names they gave the StormTroopers. I would have thought they'd
have had more <i>macho</i> names than <i>Kevin</i> or <i>Brian</i>!
<p>
Anyway, here are a few commands you can use to create some effects:
<p><UL>
<FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF"><PRE>
    AISetMoveSpeed(Kyle, 1.0);
    AISetLookPos(Kyle, GetThingPos(BombGhost));
    AISetMoveThing(Kyle, BombGhost);
</PRE></FONT></UL>
<p>
This shouldn't take too much explaining as it's pretty obvious. This code comes from
one of my levels where Kyle looks towards an object (<FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">BombGhost</FONT>)
and then runs towards it. Don't forget to set the <FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">AISetMoveSpeed</FONT>
to make it look right.
<p>
<h2>Play it again Sam</h2>
You can also play Keys for an actor to make it look like they are doing things. Define
the key you want to play by looking in that Actor's <b>.PUP</B> file as this will
tell you which keys do what action. You then "play" the key and the Actor does the action:
<p><UL>
<FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF"><PRE>
keyframe    crouch=kyusef0.key    local
int         keynum                local

[...]

    keynum=PlayKey(Kyle, crouch, 1, 0x4);

    // now do some other stuff

    StopKey(Kyle, keynum, 0);
</PRE></FONT></UL>
<p>
This code plays the animation key for kyle to crouch down and look like he is either
picking something up, putting it down or activating it. The KeyFrame will play continuously
until you use the <FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">StopKey()</FONT> command to stop playing it.
Use a <FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">Sleep()</FONT> command to get the COG to wait until you have
finished what you are doing.
<p>
<h2>That's a Wrap!</h2>
Now you've done your acting, you need to tidy-up after yourself at the end of the code.
This includes things like switching back to the Player's viewpoint, turning off the
CutScene command, making the player visible again and so on. Here's the code:
<p><UL>
<FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF"><PRE>
    // stop cutscene
    jkEndCutscene();

    // switch back to player focus
    SetCameraFocus(0, Player);

    // unfreeze Kyle
    ClearActorFlags(Player, 0xa00000);

</PRE></FONT></UL>
<p>
...and you're off again!
<p>
I haven't gone too deeply into creating cutscenes- just shown you how to create them
and what you need to do to get the right effects. As always, experimentation is the best
way of getting the knowledge, so get out there, stoke up your copy of JED and make
yourself some tasty COGs which are good enough for an Oscar!
