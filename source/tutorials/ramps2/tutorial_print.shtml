<p>It is recommended that you work through the first Ramps Tutorial (http://www.massassi.net/tutorials/ramps/).  We will begin here using the following project that I suggested saving in the last
half:</p>

<center><b>Note:</b> this is before the bottom cleaved sector was deleted!</center>
<BR><BR>
Another thing, for this tutorial, since there are more precise cleaves required,
I have switched the grid dots to 0.1, and the snap to 0.1.  As I just said, this
will allow you make more precise cleaves.
<BR><BR>
<ol>
<li> The first step in this tutorial is to cleave the bottom cleaved sector
(the one selected above) just below the original cleave, like illustrated
below.
<BR><BR>
<center><img src="2.gif"></center>
<BR><BR>
<li> Now making sure the SECTOR shown above is highlighed, switch to the top
view using [shift+1].
<BR><BR>
<li> You will notice that the sector now looks square, but remember, it is
slanted upwards, you just can't see it from this view.
<BR><BR>

<BR><BR>
<li> Now it's time to make 2 cleaves, creating a ramp in the center of your
room, going up.  Follow the diagram below to see where to make the cleaves.
I suggest switching back and forth between side and top view to make sure
you have the correct sectors selected before cleaving!

Note: if you did it correctly, your side view should still look like this:
<center><img src="5.gif"></center>
<BR><BR>
<li> Now, almost done already!  Make sure the sector below is highlighted,
and delete it!

<li> Below is the finished product, textured for clarity of course:
