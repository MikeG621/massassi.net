Misc. Author Info       : To be honest, I don't play many video games these days,
			  but I have been playing them since Pong was hot stuff,
			  so far, Jedi is the best one I've played.
			  I'm really looking forward to the new StarWars movie(May 1999)
			  I hope that the LucasArts guys produce a game similar to Jedi, but
			  give me a chance to play as a young Ben Kenobi--That would ROK!
			  ( I really hated that Titanic movie-it's been great for the tourism
			    industry here, but it's been over-exploited)

Additional Credits to   : This list keeps getting longer...
			  All at the Code Alliance,
			  Massassi Temple, without which, I'd still be trying to figure out
  			  what that red box in the middle of those purple lines is...
			  LucasArts.
			  My friends Lee, Danny, Jonathan..and many others.
