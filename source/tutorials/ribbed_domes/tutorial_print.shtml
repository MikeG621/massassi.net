<p>Before following this tutorial, be sure you can complete the Perfect Polygons and Pipes Tutorial (http://www.massassi.net/tutorials/perfect_pipes/).</p>

First, you will follow the perfect polygons tutorial until you reach the state shown in the pic. I am making a ten-sided dome.
<p><img src="rd1.gif"><p>
Now, switch to the side view and cleave it into a rough dome shape.
<P><img src="rd2.gif"><p>
Multiselect the top surfaces and cleave them in half as shown.
<p><img src="rd3.gif"><p>
Multiselect the vertexes you created and drag them away from the point as shown.
<p><img src="rd4.gif"><p>
You've created some non-planar surfaces in doing that: cleave them in the pattern shown and it'll be fine.
<P><img src="rd5.gif"><p>
Now's a good time to texture it. I also cleaved off a flat section so I can add a series of archways around the perimeter later.
<p>Continue with the perfect polygons tutorial until you've created a complete dome, then adjoin all the sectors.
<p>Voila! A ribbed dome!

Hard, wasn't it?
