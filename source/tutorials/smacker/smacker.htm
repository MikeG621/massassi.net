<BR><B>What is Smacker?</B><BR>
Smacker is by far the most popular codec (compression / decompression software) used to make 
video game cutscenes. It is used by <I>Jedi Knight</I> and over 900 other video games.

<BR><BR><B>What are cutscenes?</B><BR>
These are the video clips you see between levels in <I>Jedi Knight</I> and <I>Mysteries of 
the Sith</I>.

<BR><BR><B>Can I use Smacker to make cutscenes for <I>Mysteries of the Sith</I>?</B><BR>
No, only <I>Jedi Knight</I> uses Smacker, <I>Mysteries of the Sith</I> uses LEC's own software.
Even though those cutscenes were made as levels, they are still just videos. They are not run by the 
game engine!

<BR><BR><B>Where do I get Smacker?</B><BR>
<A HREF="http://www.radgametools.com/smkmain.htm">RAD Game Tools</A> are the makers of Smacker
and other multimedia codecs. Smacker files are made with their freeware program
<A HREF="http://www.radgametools.com/down/smacker/setup.exe">Smacker Tools (1.5 MB)</A>

<BR><BR><B>What else do I need?</B><BR>
The images (or an AVI movie clip) you want compressed into a Smacker file, and maybe a sound
file to mix in with them. You can render the images using any 3D animation program, the most
popular ones being TrueSpace and 3D Studio MAX.

<BR><BR><B>What size rendering window should I use?</B><BR>
I recommend 640x300, the size of the Jedi Knight cutscenes. You can have any size window, but the result will either be off-center or clipped since
<I>Jedi Knight</I> places the top left corner at about (0,80) on 640x480 screen.

<BR><BR><B>What if I don't want to make an animation?</B><BR>
The <A HREF="http://www.swma.net/">Star Wars 3D Modelling Alliance</A> has over 100 short
movie clips to download, just make sure you get the author's permission before using them in 
your level. Most are AVI format but a few are MPEG which Smacker cannot use. Another problem
is that all the clips are smaller than 640x300 and while Smacker can change the window size,
it doesn't resize the graphics.

<BR><BR><B>Where do I put the Smacker files?</B><BR>
In your <I>Jedi Knight</I> directory, create a <CODE>Resources/Video</CODE> directory. 
<I>Jedi Knight</I> will only look for Smacker files in that directory. Do not put them in 
the project directory as JED will include them in the GOB file, even if they are not used. 

<BR><BR><B>How do I Include Smacker files in a level?</B><BR>
Open JED's Episode Editor and in the Sequence List place the cursor where you want each 
cutscene to appear, then press <I>Add</I>. If you can make sense of the example list shown below, you
should be able to edit the other fields. Remember to press <I>Update</I> before moving to another line,
otherwise your changes will be lost.

<BR><B>Why does Jedi Knight skip a Smacker cutscene?</B><BR>
<I>Jedi Knight</I> cannot find it. First, make sure the correct Smacker file is in the 
<CODE>Resources/Video</CODE> directory, then compare the file name to the one listed in JED's
Episode Editor.

<BR><BR><B>Why do I get an error message in <I>Jedi Knight</I>?</B><BR>
This happens when <I>Jedi Knight</I> tries to access a Smacker file from a GOB file. 
Move the Smacker file from the project directory to the <CODE>Resources/Video</CODE> directory.

<TD>TrueSpace is An excellent learning program for 3D modelling. You can download a full 
version from here - <A HREF="http://www.pcplus.co.uk/article.asp?ID=8561">Truespace v1.04</A>

<TD>3D Studio Max is the industry standard, but is far too expensive for most hobbyists. However, if
you want a job as a 3D modeller you had better learn it!

<TD>Crossroads is freeware and will convert between most graphics file formats. 
Very useful since TrueSpace 1.04 doesn't support 3D Studio 3DS models.</TD></TR>

<BR><B>Credits</B><BR>
I'd like to thank Jonathan Clark and Darkness Falls for their <A HREF="http://www.jediknight.net/darkfall/jkarts/smacktut.html">
Smacker Tutoiral</A>. It was very helpful in getting me started with cutscenes and is a good
tutorial in using the Smacker Tools program.
