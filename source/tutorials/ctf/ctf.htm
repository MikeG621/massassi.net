	CTF (Capture The Flag) is a incredible composition of complex COG
work and level design.  CTF can be very easy to install, however
it can also be painstaking work if you have never had experience with
it.  I hope this tutor will help you.  Some of the terms that I am going to use 
may be a little bit more advanced since this tutor was not written for a 
novice editor.  Enough of that, on to how to make CTF.
<BR><BR>
	The problem I had with CTF was how to place the things.
You must have the "Thing Placement" in the "JKL" file in correct order.
<BR><BR>
Here is the correct "Thing Placement" for CTF to work correctly.
(Note: The terms that I use will be explained later, and I've used "Thing Numbers"
1 - 46 in in my chart.

                                           lag.  More on this later. Red Team.</td></tr>

	Ok now that I have shown you the correct order in which "Things"
should be placed. I will now go on to installing CTF, which will use my definitions
of things above within it.
<BR><BR>
Now I will add the appropriate thing values of what they should be in your
placed COG which is CTF_MAIN.COG.

I know how to use these but I have been unable to display

holding up say the letter "B" and looking in the mirror at
it completly ass-backwards.  If you can figure this out
please let me know.</td></tr>

Don't worry about the last 4.  Same problem as with the Limits
<BR><BR>
I will now explain CTF_SAFEENTRY.COG.

	Now the format of the level will be explian using a simplistic level
with the basic components needs for a CTF level to work correctly.
<BR><BR>
<img src="Ctf5.jpg">
<BR><BR>

(i) This is your start sector so get the sectors number and put that into 
the CTF_MAIN.COG where it says Start_Room.  The things that are present in
this sector are things 37 - 44 these are the inital start places for players.
<BR><BR>
(ii) This is defined in CTF_SAFEENTRY.COG under the value of Mark_Red.  
So get the value of the sector and input it under the Mark_Red value.
This is important to the game because if lag is to great and you are not 
teleported into the game with your color it will put you back infront of
the team select sector.
<BR><BR>
(iii) This is the Ghost_Red value in the CTF_SAFEENTRY.COG mark the thing
number under that value.
<BR><BR>
(iiii) This sector has two functions.  The first is Mark_Red in the CTF_MAIN.COG.
the second function is for CTF_RESPAWN.COG which the sectors value is placed
again in the Mark_Red.
<BR><BR>
(iiiii) Same as (ii) but for the Gold team.
<BR><BR>
(iiiiii) Same as (iii) but for the gold team.
<BR><BR>
(iiiiiii) Same as (iiii) but for the gold team.
<BR><BR>
Ok now that all this values are entered and if you have done this correctly
your CTF should work.
<BR><BR>
Now for a explanation of the mechanics.
<BR><BR>
The CTF_MAIN.COG designates the Walkplayers from 37 - 44 as the start players
thats why you must define a start sector.
<BR><BR>
Next a player has entered a game and he/she decides to goto the Red team so
they enter the Mark_Red sector or (iiii) as I have defined above and then 
the CTF_RESPAWN.COG chooses a random start point using the ghost things 
5 - 12.  Say a player does not enter the game correctly the CTF_SAFEENTRY.COG
teleports the play back to the Ghost_Red thing so he can try to enter again.
<BR><BR>
Thats it except for when a player dies the CTF_MAIN.COG has a internal code
which is not defined to Respawn players from Walkplayer 29 - 36 for Red Team
and 37 - 44 for Gold Team.
