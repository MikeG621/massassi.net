<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So you are tired of the Stormtroopers dialogue,
or it just doesnt fit the action of say your new cutscene?
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well then you are fortunate! Fiddling around
with various sound software the other day, i finally
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; discovered a way to make a normal sounding
sound file have that filtered sound of a stormtrooper.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now im sure that some of you already know
how to do this, but i had never gotten my stormie sounds to be this
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; precise.Also included are ways of making garbled
radio chatter like the x-wing pilots in Sw:Anh, and an easy way
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of making sure your new wavs have the correct
header when saving it.So without further adue heres some tips on
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; how to make your own filtered wavs:

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ok, you need two programs for this. (Other
than Jk and Mots of course) The first one is ConMan-for extracting
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp; sounds from the Gobs and Goos,
its available at <A HREF="www.darkjedi.com">www.darkjedi.com</A>.The other
one is a sound editor called
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Goldwave, you can download at <A HREF="www.goldwave.com">www.goldwave.com</A>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now remember that this sound editor
is a shareware program, you can use all&nbsp; the fancy stuff, save your
stuff and so on,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but it shuts down after you have used
it for a while.Not a problem though, just open it again.:)
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Remember, if youre going to buy an audio
shareware prog, this is it.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have mostly all of the fancy sound
stuff out there, but this one is still my favourite since the days of Dark
Forces
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; because it can handle a variety of sound
formats inluding Df's Voc's.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Note: For this Tutorial im using Goldwave
3.24.There is a newer version out now,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but its a beta.(you use it the same
way in that one anyway)
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And im using sounds from both Jk and
Mots, since the stormtroopers in Mots&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dont have any "clicking" sounds when
they speak mysteriously enough...

<P>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.Extract i00s111z.wav from Jk's Res1hi.gob
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.Extract rc61121.wav from&nbsp; Mots's
JKMsndLO.goo
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.Open them both up in Goldwave, this
is what you should see:
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;<IMG SRC="wavs.gif" HEIGHT=532 WIDTH=562>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4.Select the rebel commando wav, rc61121.wav
(which we will make into a stormtrooper)
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and access the effects pulldown menu.Now
choose "Filter", followed by "Bandpass/stop"
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the filter that you will use:
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;<IMG SRC="filter.gif" HEIGHT=345 WIDTH=440>

<P>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5.For this particular wav file we dont
have to change any of the presets really, just
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; set it to "Dynamic" and the steepness
to 2, that should do it.Now these variables vary
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on other sound files, you are going
to have to experiment with them yourself.And there
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; are loads of other fx you can come up
with, com radio chatter and so on. I myself managed
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to fix up a filter who sounded exactly
like the Rebel pilots garbled radio communications
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with each other on the attack of the
death star.I'll show you how to do that further down.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ok, take a listen to the new rebel commando
wav, sounds like a stormtrooper right? Almost.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First we have to polish it up a bit,
select this part of the stormie wav, copy it and use "paste at
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; beginning" on the rc wav, like this:
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;<IMG SRC="click1.gif" HEIGHT=302 WIDTH=448>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6. This lets the our new stormie
wav have those clicking sounds that are missing from Mots, repeat
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it with the end "click" noise
from the original st wav like this:
<CENTER>&nbsp;</CENTER>

<CENTER>&nbsp;</CENTER>
&nbsp;<IMG SRC="click2.gif" HEIGHT=302 WIDTH=677>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There ya go, with the filter laid
and both clicking sounds, the end result should look something like this:
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;<IMG SRC="result.gif" HEIGHT=326 WIDTH=679>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ok, that would be it, you may
find it a bit too quiet, so did i. thats easy to fix though.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just raise the volume of it in
goldwave. :)
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh yeah, the garbled x-wing radio
communications ala Sw:Anh...
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Makes the sounds a bit Wobbly.(Watch
the film if you cant remember! :) )
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thats another filter called
"Mechanize" it looks like this :
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;<IMG SRC="mech.gif" HEIGHT=315 WIDTH=530>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This one is easier to apply, but
harder to get it right, since there are fewer options.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On some sounds you have to use
another filter to make them more radio-like.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GoldleaderGoingIn.wav here is
a stormtrooper wav which i used mechanize quality 20 on.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since it already had a radio-ish
quality to it, it sounded exactly like the rebels in A new hope.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As an extra tip: If your own custom
wav file that you have recorded yourself, should be in
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; some sort of wrong format. i.e.
not mots or jk's, or the Hz of the file would be wrong,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; thats easy to fix too, just do
this:
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;<IMG SRC="cutnpaste.gif" HEIGHT=365 WIDTH=562>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Open both your wav and
the either one from mots or jk.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Use "Cut" on the mots/jk
wav so its totally black.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Paste your wav into the
empty mots/jk one.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Save it under a new name,
and dont change the settings in save.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This lets your new wav keep
the header settings of the one its pasted into.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, thats it really.Just
remember: The LucasartsWavs in Jk/Mots are
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Copyrighted, i only used
these for a demonstration everyone owning these
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; games could follow.So dont
go editing them, use these filters with your own sounds.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And dont stick to the preset
filters either.Experiment wildly, the results can be weird! :)
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Happy editing!
