<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong><font face="Verdana">For those of you who have read the
message boards fairly recently, you might know that I figured out a way to do fog in Jedi
Knight. Well, one day I was talking to Evan on ICQ and he told me of this great idea that
would greatly improve the fog. When I re-wrote the fog cog, (whoo! rhyming words!) I
decided it was time to write this tutorial. To understand this tutorial, all you need to
do is be able to place a cog and fill in the fields, and place a ghost thing. There won't
be any pictures for following this tutorial, for there isn't much to show.&nbsp; There is
a screenshot, however.</font></strong></p>

<p><strong><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To start out, you need the <a
href="fog2.cog">cog</a>.&nbsp; Place this in your project directory under the /cog
directory.&nbsp; Now in your level, place a ghost thing where you want the thickest,
central part of the fog to be located.&nbsp; The height <em>does </em>matter here, so if
you want the fog to be about head high, put the ghost thing about head high.</font></strong></p>

<p><strong><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, go to the placed cogs window and
add fog2.cog to your level.&nbsp; The fields:</font></strong> 

<ul>
  <li><strong><font face="Verdana">ghost(thing): the ghost thing you just placed.</font></strong></li>
  <li><strong><font face="Verdana">r(int): value for red.</font></strong></li>
  <li><strong><font face="Verdana">g(int): value for green.</font></strong></li>
  <li><strong><font face="Verdana">b(int): value for blue.</font></strong></li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong><font face="Verdana">Yes, you could make colored fog if you wanted
to, but for now, we are going to stick with grey.&nbsp; For r, g, and b, a number from
about 100 to 200 is generally a good fog level.&nbsp; 100 is fairly light, while 200 is
getting rather thick.</font></strong></p>

<p><strong><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, save your level, do save jkl and
test, or gob it, which ever you want to do, and play.&nbsp; If you are a ways away from
the ghost, there will be no fog.&nbsp; If you get closer, there will be a light fog, the
closer you get, the darker the fog gets.</font></strong></p>
