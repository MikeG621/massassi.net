<p>The first part of this tutorial will show you how to link two rooms together
with a slanted walkway (ramp).  It is very basic.  The second part will show you
how to expand upon that concept to create a multitude of interesting features 
you can use in your levels.</p>

<ol>
<li> Start with the default sector in Jed, choose a surface, select it, and
extrude it, using the [x] key.  Then, extrude the exact opposite surface of the
original sector.  You should have 3 sectors, adjoined like this:
<br><br>
<center><img src="1.gif"></center>
<br><br>
<li> Now, extrude the top surface of the original, center, sector.
<BR><BR>
<center><img src="3.gif"></center>
<BR><BR>
<li> The next step is to select the top surface of one of the remaining two
"outside" sectors, and extrude that.  It should be the exact same height as
the extrude of the center sector.  Now, select the surface between the two
top sectors, and adjoin it using the [a] key.  This will allow you to pass
between the two sectors.
<BR><BR>

<BR><BR>
<li> Now, select the bottom corner sector (you must be in sector mode), and
delete it using the [delete] key.
<BR><BR>
<center><b>Note:</b> This is the sector you must delete:<br><br><img src="5.gif"></center>
<BR><BR>
<center><b>Note:</b> This is how it should look after you delete the sector:<br><br>
<img src="6.gif"></center>
<BR><BR>
<li>  Now, I suggest you save a backup copy of this level so far, because I will
work off of it in my next tutorial, on catwalk-like ramps.
<BR><BR>
<li> Okay, now use the [shift+2] keys to get a side view, and select the
original sector, as shown in the illustration below.
<BR><BR>
<center><img src="7.gif"></center>
<BR><BR>
<li> Press the [c] key to invoke the cleaver, and cleave a diagonal line as
shown below, from the bottom corner of the default sector, to the opposite top
corner.
<BR><BR>
<center><img src="8.gif"></center>
<BR><BR>
<li> Okay, now delete the bottom sector that resulted from your previous
cleave. It is the one that is selected in the above diagram.
<BR><BR>
<li> This is the end result, textured for clarity, of course:
