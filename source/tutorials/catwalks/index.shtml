<p>*Note: additions to the original
tutorial are in <font color="#00FFFF">this color</font>. I think
its turquoise, but I don't know for sure. LOL. Anyway, here goes.
:)</p>

<p>First off, so I don't get sued, I would
like to thank the Massassi Temple for their tutorials. Especially
<a href="mailto:brian@massassi.net">Brian Lozier</a> with his <a href="/tutorials/outdoor/">&quot;Creating Outdoor Buildings&quot;</a>
tutorial. This tutorial contains the same basic principal, except
more detailed. This tutorial was not made to insult advanced
editors, but to give &quot;newbies&quot; some techniques.
Anyway, thanks again to the Massassi Temple for helping get my
start in editing. Also, thanks goes to <a href="http://www.code-alliance.com/">Alexei Novikov</a> for such a great JK editor!!!</p>

<p>With that taken care of, I was working
on a level for my clan, Sabers Lightside, when I got the idea to
create catwalks (actually, I already had the idea, but I ended up
playing with Jed and figured out how to make them). Just to let
you know, this is my first tutorial, so bear with me :).</p>

<p>First off, fire up JED and you will see
the basic cube. First, press F4 to bring up the map settings
window. Set the snap to 0.01, there is going to be a lot of
detail involved, sort of :). With that done, snap to side view,
shift-2, and cleave where you want the top of your catwalk to be.
Next, cleave just a little below to make the catwalk itself. You
do not want a fat catwalk, thus the cleave right below.</p>

<p><img src="image1.gif" width="600" height="450"></p>

<p>Note: Make sure when you cleave your
lines are straight, or else you'll get a crooked catwalk. this is
important because of the small snap.</p>

<p>Next, switch to the top view with the
small sector selected, and cleave out how wide you want the
catwalk to be. Make sure you have the right sector selected
before you switch to the top view.</p>

<p><img src="image2.gif" width="600" height="450"></p>

<p>My catwalk is the small sector on the left. Go on down to the next step.</p>

<p><font color="#00FFFF">Now comes the next step. If you want to
be able to walk on the catwalk, you need to select the top
surface of the walk. Ok? Now, press enter and the surface box
thingy comes up. Double-click on the surface flags. To make the
surface usable, make sure the flag &quot;Floor&quot; and
&quot;Impassible&quot; is checked, like so:</font></p>

<p><font color="#00FFFF"><img src="image4.gif" width="800"
height="600"></font></p>

<p><font color="#00FFFF">After all that is finished, select the
small sector and delete it!! That's right, get rid of it! This
creates a negative-space effect, explained in the next paragraph.
Read on. :)</font></p>

<p><font color="#00FFFF">Now to explain how these negative-space
effects are achieved. It is really quite simple. The sector that
was deleted created a kind of &quot;hole&quot; in the big sector
itself. Since JK knows this can't be, and JED also knows this
can't be. The surfaces that were part of the sector were shared
with the surface directly above them in the other parts of the
sector. When am I going to get to the point? Well here it is: the
surfaces on the surrounding sectors wrap around the hole that was
made, creating a solid catwalk. Hope that clears up any doubt as
to why this worked for newbies. :)</font></p>

<p>If you go to 3d preview, you will see a
catwalk. Here is mine, textured for clarity of course!</p>

<p><img src="image3.gif" width="600" height="450"></p>

<p>And Presto! An excellent catwalk if you
ask me. If you want another catwalk above it, repeat the steps,
just be sure that you know where you are cleaving and which
sector you are deleting beforehand. If you have any questions,
you can reach me at <a href="mailto:Loner0man@hotmail.com">Loner0man@hotmail.com</a>. Or I can be reached by ICQ. My ICQ number is
40795807. Have fun and happy catwalk creating!</p>
