<p>This will teach you how to make multi-celled mats.
A multi-celled mat is one like a switch that has 
2 different pictures on one mat. When you activate
a switch it goes to it's second cell so it looks 
like a button has been pushed, or a switch has been
thrown. Here is what you do. Create 2 bmp files. They should 
be equal in size and shape and pallette file. Save
one as yourname1.bmp and they other as yourname2.bmp</p>

<p>Now, open up notepad and create a file like this:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><font size="3" color="silver">MATM
FILENAME: C:\path\test.mat

TEXTURES: 2
yourname1.bmp
yourname2.bmp
</font></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>The first line just says that this is a mat master script.
The second line is a path for where the mat will be 
created. The next line after the space tells the program
how many pictures(cells) are in the mat. Below it is a 
list of the pictures in it. Save this file as yourname.mtm</p>

<p>Now, open up MatMaster (available at <a href="http://www.darkjedi.com" target="_top">http://www.darkjedi.com</a>)
and then click the button "compile MTM to MAT" and then
click on the first button next to the box "input file name"
Open up yourname.mtm, select colourmap options and then click convert. You have
a multi-celled mat.</p>
