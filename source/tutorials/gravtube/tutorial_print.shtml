Have you ever wanted to go flying up a shaft without having to put
in all those messy elevator settings?? Well, anti-grav tubes (as seen in
Blades of Death DM level) are a great way to achieve this. This very easy
COG can help to spice up even the most boring level. Here's how to do it:

<P>First, let's start a new level. You should see the very familiar basic
sector. Now cleave that baby up!! From the top view (1) cleave it so that
there's a sector about 4x4m (any size will do, really, but I'm using 4x4m) going straight
up the middle of what was your original sector. Now find this 4x4 middle
sector, and find its top face. Extrude that face!!! Drag it up high!! Now
use the 'k' command to throw in another sector the same size as the original,
and place it on top of the pipe you just made. Find your new sector's bottom
face, cleave it up just like the bottom sector, and adjoin the middle face.
now you should have something like this:<br><br>

<P>And, if you press the infamous 'F12' button (or in other words, go to
3D Preview):<br><br>

<P>....You should get something like this, now let's colour it in!!!....<br><br>

<CENTER><IMG SRC="newgrav1_5.jpg" ></CENTER>

<P>.....awwww, pretty!! (excuse the tacky textures, just trying to show
things up!!)

<P>Now to start getting a little technical!! Get your 'pipe' sector (the
one up the middle for those of us who are a little slow) and press 'Enter'.
You should get a window with all of the variables for that sector. Now
all you've gotta do is change a bit here, input something else there and
change all that, and your done!! Here, have a look at this:<br><br>

<P>Firstly, I want you to look at the blue window bar at the top and note
down the number of the sector (in my case its 5, as circled). Next, ignore
all that flags and light and colourmap crap, go straight to tint, and double
click on it. Chose a colour that you like (red looks good in an anti-grav
tube) and select it. Now, out in the sector editor again, go to my third
circle, at the sounds, choose a nice sound by double clicking for the list
(for those out there who don't know, a + before the variable means that
you can double-click on it to see the options) and pump up the volume a
bit. You need to do this both for the big pipe up the middle and the little
sector in the middle of the original one, I mean the one that the pipe
comes out of. Now that takes care of it, almost.....well sort of........well
ok, to tell the truth, all that would happen when the player walks in there
is that he would see a heap of red and hear a strange sound, but here's
how to make him go up: first, you need Conman, so if you haven't already
got it, go to darkjedi.com and get
it. Now, once you have it, or if you already have it, open it up and open
jk1mp.gob (in your episode folder) and go down to cogs, pick out the right
COG (which happens to be 'm5_antigrav.cog') and extract it to your project
directory.

<P>Now that it's in there, you should be able to go to 'placed cogs' and
'add cog' and see this under project directory:<br><br>

<P>Good, now add the COG and go to the variables, put in the numbers of
BOTH of the sectors that you had to note before, it should look like this:<br><br>

<P>Well that's it, if you have any questions, feel free to ask me, e-mail
me or use ICQ to contact me on 15649749.</p>
