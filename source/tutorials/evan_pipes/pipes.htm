Pipes can be used in many different ways. In the original JK levels pipes are
used a lot for things such as feul storage and drains. Level 9 has a whole
section of amazing pipe architechture.
This tutorial is designed to help you make fantastic pipe architechture with
some quick and simple techniques.
<BR><BR>
The first thing we'll look at is creating bends in the pipe. I've started by
cleaving out a simple pipe sector. The shape I've chosen for this is a 
circular pipe but octagons and other shapes could be used.
<BR><BR>

<BR><BR>
What we'll do now is copy the sector(CTRL + C) and paste a new one in the 
level(CTRL + V). This sector will be a temporary sector we use to create the 
bends for the pipe. Cleave it into 3 peices, each one 0.6 jkus long(delete 
the left over sector at the end).
<BR><BR>
<CENTER><img src="pipes2.gif"></CENTER>
<BR><BR>
Select one of the end sectors and push F9 to go into the JED tools box. We are
now going to rotate the sector a bit along the z-axis. We will rotate it 15
degrees.
<BR><BR>
<CENTER><img src="pipes3.gif"></CENTER>
<BR><BR>
Now select the other end sector. Do the same as before only rotate it -15 
degrees.
<BR><BR>
<CENTER><img src="pipes4.gif"></CENTER>
<BR><BR>
Delete the 2 end sectors. We now have a section of the pipe bend. Rotate it 15
degrees to make it straight with the other sector. Line it up with our other
sector(NOTE: it may be nessecary to line it up from 2 different views).
<BR><BR>
<CENTER><img src="pipes5.gif"></CENTER>
<BR><BR>
Copy the sector twice and then line each of these new sectors up.
<BR><BR>
<CENTER><img src="pipes6.gif"></CENTER>
<BR><BR>
We now have a completed bend on our pipe. To finish it off just adjoin the
surfaces between the peices.
The number of peices in the bend is determined by the amount the ends are
rotated. In this example we used 15 degrees which means each peice covered
30 degrees(15 each side). 30 goes into 90 degrees 3 times, so we have 3 peices.
If we had made the rotation 5 degrees and -5 degrees each peice would cover
10 degrees, meaning 9 would be needed to complete a 90 degree bend.
<BR><BR>
<BR><BR>
<BR><BR>
The next thing we'll learn is how to create beams inside the pipes. Take our
default pipe again and cleave it up into 5 new sectors like in the picture.
<BR><BR>
<CENTER><img src="pipes7.gif"></CENTER>
<BR><BR>
Select the middle sector and then go to the tools menu again(F9). Now we will
re-size the middle sector by 0.7. What you should now see is that the pipe
has shrunk in the middle to create a circular beam around the pipe.
<BR><BR>
<CENTER><img src="pipes8.gif"></CENTER>
<BR><BR>
If we now look at the pipe in 3d preview you will see the beam around the 
outside of the pipe(textured for clarity).
<BR><BR>

<BR><BR>
These techniques should help you create some nice looking pipes. Good luck!
