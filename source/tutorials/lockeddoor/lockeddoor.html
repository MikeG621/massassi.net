OK, before I start this tutorial theres somthing I'd like to say, use locked doors sparingly in your SP levels.
 Think of other ideas for puzzles besides locked doors, as they're boring puzzles, but they do give a new objective
for the player. I'm going to assume you have basic knowledge of JED and you know how to make doors.   OK that said
lets get to the tutorial.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG SRC="Basic.gif" WIDTH="267" HEIGHT="274" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"><BR>
<BR>
Here we have our default JED box, lets start by cleaving a hall. Cleave it out like so:<BR>
<BR>
<IMG SRC="Cleaved.gif" WIDTH="367" HEIGHT="321" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"><BR>
<BR>
Now extrude it:<BR>
<BR>
<IMG SRC="Extrude.gif" WIDTH="432" HEIGHT="328" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"><BR>
<BR>
OK now we have a basic hall.  Put in door using the </FONT><A HREF="http://www.massassi.net/tutorials/doors/"><FONT
SIZE="4">door tutorial</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="4" COLOR="#006600">.In the end it should look something like this:<BR>
<BR>
<IMG SRC="Door.gif" WIDTH="519" HEIGHT="349" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"><BR>
<BR>
 Instead of using 00_Door.cog use 00_DoorKey.cog by going to placed cogs... add cog... 00_DoorKey.cog. We have
some values to place in the cog.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG SRC="Values.gif" WIDTH="197" HEIGHT="197" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"><BR>
<BR>
OK what do these values Mean:<BR>
Door 0-3: These are the door things the cog uses. *Note, if you put other values for doors other than Door0, then
when one opens they all will open.<BR>
<BR>
Movespeed: the speed the door moves (higher is faster)<BR>
<BR>
Sleeptime: How long the door stays open.<BR>
<BR>
LightValue: How much extra light is added. (Leave this value alone)<BR>
<BR>
Key: the key color needed to open the door.  Put a 0 for red 1 for blue and 2 for yellow.<BR>
<BR>
Wav0: The locked sound for the door. (Leave this alone)<BR>
<BR>
Fill in the appropriate values. Here are mine:<BR>
<BR>
<IMG SRC="Placevalues.gif" WIDTH="205" HEIGHT="198" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"><BR>
<BR>
OK now add a key. Sense I chose 1, Blue, I'll add a blue key. To do this I press insert in item mode and chose
KeyBlue.  It should look something like this in JED:<BR>
<BR>
<IMG SRC="GOODINJED.gif" WIDTH="486" HEIGHT="398" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"><BR>
<BR>
Now if you saved and gobbed your key door would work, But look what happens when you try to open the door with
no key:<BR>
<BR>
<IMG SRC="Wrongtext.gif" WIDTH="640" HEIGHT="400" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"><BR>
<BR>
How do we fix this?  Quite simple really and we will have to add something called level text to do this press F8.
Click edit strings.  You will see this:<BR>
<BR>
<IMG SRC="Strings.gif" WIDTH="640" HEIGHT="480" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"><BR>
<BR>
OK all you have to do is type COG_01001 in the Key Box and Locked! in the String Box. Like so:<BR>
<BR>
<IMG SRC="Goodstring.gif" WIDTH="640" HEIGHT="480" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"><BR>
<BR>
 Now press add/Update.  Exit the string editor. Press update and then save in the episode editor and exit. MAKE
SURE YOU SAVE YOUR EPISODE. Note how you character says LOCKED! instead of COG_01001.  You could make him say anything.
 All Done! Here are a few working pics:<BR>
