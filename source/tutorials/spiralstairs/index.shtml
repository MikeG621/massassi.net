Spiral stairs can look very nice in a level, and despite how it looks, their
not very hard to make.
<br><br>
We'll be using the default sector. It should be noted that for clarity in the pictures, I'm using
very tall stairs - you'll want to use a smaller grid step, like .03 for your stairs in an actual
level.
<br><br>
In top view, cleave the default sector into a dodecagon (12 sides).. If you 
don't want to mess with that, just make an octagon.. (dodecagon just looks 
nicer in the finished project.. rounder) Delete all the sectors but the 12 
sided one (or 8 sided)
<br>

<br>
Now cleave the sector like a pie.. Holding down shift while you cleave will
make the cleave snap to the vertices.
<br>

<br>
Select one of the newly-formed triangle sectors and go to side view.
Cleave 0.1 off the bottom of it, and delete it. (delete the 0.1 of it, not 
the rest of the sector)
<br>
<center><img src="spiral3.jpg"></center>
<br>
Select a sector next to the one you just cleaved and in side view, make a 
a sector cleave parallel with the top of the last sector you deleted.. Look
at the picture for a better explanation.. Then make another cleave 0.1 above
the last one. This will give you a 0.1 tall sector.. Delete it, and check the
3d preview.. You'll see that you now have two stairs..
<br>

<br>
Repeat this process, moving one sector over and cleaving a line parallel to 
the top of the last stair, then making a cleave 0.1 above that and deleting 
the sector between the two cleaves.

<br>
That's it.. You now have, in effect, a spiral staircase.. It doesn't look 
real pretty, but this tutor's just for the basics.. You can add a small pole 
in the middle of the staircase to make things look nicer, but that's just 
some simple sector cleaving and deleting, a technique taught in many other 
tutorials, so there's no reason to explain it here :)
