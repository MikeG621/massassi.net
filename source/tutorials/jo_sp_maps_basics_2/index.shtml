<p>Alright, I'm going to assume you have a level or something to test your character's new Force powers. It's not a terrible task to change Force powers, just follow this tutorial and I will take you on an easy ride through the wonders of Force power settings. </p>

<p><dl><dt><b>Tools needed:</b></dt>
<dd><li>GtkRadiant / JK2Radiant &mdash; Jedi Outcast map editor</li></dd>
<dd><li>BehavEd &mdash; Jedi Outcast Icarus Script Editor</li></dd>
<dd><li>Wordpad &mdash; Text Editor</li></dd>
</dl></p>

<p>I am also expecting that your Radiant editor and BehavEd are correctly setup. Radiant does most of it for you, but I believe you have to go set the paths right in the BehavEd Preferences (Prefs button).</p>

<p>First we're going to start by creating the Icarus script that will set your Force powers.  Create a new folder within <i>jedioutcast/gamedata/</i>. This will allow you to load your mod up in-game through the Mods option. In this folder you have just created, create yet another one, and this time name it <i>scripts</i>. We need to create one more folder. Create it within the scripts folder, and give it the name as that of your level. For now we'll name it <i>project1</i> Once you've done this, create a new text file in there. Call it <i>level_start.txt</i>.</p>

<p>Open up <i>jedioutcast/gamedata/projectfolder/scripts/project1/level_start.txt</i> in Wordpad, then copy and paste the following code into the text file:</p>

<font size="3" color="silver">
<pre>
rem ( "script run at start of level" ); 
rem ( "set up force powers and weapons" ); 

affect ( "kyle", /*@AFFECT_TYPE*/ FLUSH ) 
{ 
// Neutral Force 
                set ( /*@SET_TYPES*/ "SET_FORCE_JUMP_LEVEL", /*@FORCE_LEVELS*/ "0" ); 
                set ( /*@SET_TYPES*/ "SET_FORCE_PUSH_LEVEL", /*@FORCE_LEVELS*/ "0" ); 
                set ( /*@SET_TYPES*/ "SET_FORCE_PULL_LEVEL", /*@FORCE_LEVELS*/ "0" ); 
                set ( /*@SET_TYPES*/ "SET_FORCE_SPEED_LEVEL", /*@FORCE_LEVELS*/ "0" ); 
                set ( /*@SET_TYPES*/ "SET_FORCE_SEEING_LEVEL", /*@FORCE_LEVELS*/ "0" ); 
// Light Force 
                set ( /*@SET_TYPES*/ "SET_FORCE_ABSORB_LEVEL", /*@FORCE_LEVELS*/ "0" ); 
                set ( /*@SET_TYPES*/ "SET_FORCE_HEAL_LEVEL", /*@FORCE_LEVELS*/ "0" ); 
                set ( /*@SET_TYPES*/ "SET_FORCE_PROTECT_LEVEL", /*@FORCE_LEVELS*/ "0" ); 
                set ( /*@SET_TYPES*/ "SET_FORCE_MINDTRICK_LEVEL", /*@FORCE_LEVELS*/ "0" ); 
// Dark Force 
                set ( /*@SET_TYPES*/ "SET_FORCE_GRIP_LEVEL", /*@FORCE_LEVELS*/ "0" ); 
                set ( /*@SET_TYPES*/ "SET_FORCE_DRAIN_LEVEL", /*@FORCE_LEVELS*/ "0" ); 
                set ( /*@SET_TYPES*/ "SET_FORCE_LIGHTNING_LEVEL", /*@FORCE_LEVELS*/ "0" ); 
                set ( /*@SET_TYPES*/ "SET_FORCE_DARK_RAGE_LEVEL", /*@FORCE_LEVELS*/ "0" ); 
// Saber Abilities 
                set ( /*@SET_TYPES*/ "SET_SABER_THROW", /*@FORCE_LEVELS*/ "0" ); 
                set ( /*@SET_TYPES*/ "SET_SABER_DEFENSE", /*@FORCE_LEVELS*/ "0" ); 
                set ( /*@SET_TYPES*/ "SET_SABER_OFFENSE", /*@FORCE_LEVELS*/ "0" ); 
} 
</pre></font>

<p>If you leave the code as it is right now, your player will start with no Force powers whatsoever. It's great for Single Player levels where your player is not a Jedi or any sort of Force user.</p>

<p>For each Force power, you can set the "rank" of power you want your player to have. So, if you wanted to have your player have a rank of 2 for Force Jump and a rank 3 for Force Push, the code would look like this:</p>

<font size="3" color="silver">
<pre>set ( /*@SET_TYPES*/ "SET_FORCE_JUMP_LEVEL", /*@FORCE_LEVELS*/ "2" );
set ( /*@SET_TYPES*/ "SET_FORCE_PUSH_LEVEL", /*@FORCE_LEVELS*/ "3" ); 
</pre></font>

<p>There is a maximum rank for each Force power. Without cheat codes in Jedi Outcast, the maximum level you reach in both Single Player and Multiplayer alike is 3. I was told with cheating you could go up to 5, but I haven't experienced this as of yet.</p>

<p>Save your text file and launch BehaveEd, a tool that comes with the latest release of Raven's Jedi Outcast Editing Tools (along with the MP source code and such). In BehaveEd, load up your <i>level_start.txt</i> file. Simply click on the <i>Compile!</i> button down in the lower right corner of your screen. This will compile your script into <i>level_start.ibi</i> which is a compiled version that will work in JO.</p>

<p>Now we're going to implant this into your level. Make sure that <i>level_start.ibi</i> is in <i>jedioutcast/gamedata/yourproject/scripts/project1/level_start.txt</i>. Load up your map in GTKRadiant. Once it's loaded, create a new <i>info_player_start</i> entity (right-click on the map and select it from the entity list [<i>info > info_player_start</i>]) and place it where you want your player to start. Then, create another entity near the <i>info_player_start</i> called <i>target_scriptrunner </i>(<i>target > target_scriptrunner</i>). </p>

<p>With the <i>target_scriptrunner</i> entity selected, open the entity properties window (press the N key). Once that is open, enter the following commands in the <i>Key</i> and <i>Value</i> boxes:</p>

<font size="3" color="silver">
<pre>// This will give your entity a name so you can target it 
Key                         Targetname 
Value                      run_level_start

// This is the code to run your script
Key                         Usescript 
Value                      project1/level_start 
</pre></font>

<p>Once you have added these keys and values, deselect the <i>target_scriptrunner</i> entity and select the info_player_start entity. We're going to target the <i>target_scriptrunner</i> entity. There are two ways of achieving this. Both are easy and do the same job. </p>

<p><b>Method 1:</b> Open up the entity property windows (when you have the <i>info_player_start</i> entity selected) and enter: 

<font size="3" color="silver">
<pre>// This code tells the entity to fire the target when you spawn. 
Key                         Target 
Value                      run_level_start 
</pre></font></p>

<p><b>Method 2:</b> First select the <i>info_player_start</i> entity first, and then add the <i>target_scriptrunner</i> entity to your selection. Then press Ctrl-K; this targets the second selection (You must select them in order. If you select the <i>target_scriptrunner</i> entity first then the <i>info_player_start</i> entity, it'll be <i>target_scriptrunner</i> targetting <i>info_start_player</i>. This won't work. It needs to be the other way around.).</p>

<p>Now save and compile your level. Create a new PK3 file with the new script file in under the <i>scripts/project1/</i> folder. Make sure this PK3 file is saved under your mod directory. Start up Jedi Outcast in Single Player mode. Go to <i>Options</i>, then to <i>Mods</i>. If you have the patched version of the game, your mod directory name should appear in the mod list (If you don't, then <a href="http://support.lucasarts.com/patches/patches.htm" target="_blank">download the new JO patches</a> and update your game!). Click on your mod and click <i>Load Mod</i>.</p>

If you have read through <a href="/tutorials/jo_sp_maps_basics_1/">Single-Player JO Maps, Part 1 : General Stuff</a> then your level should load when you press <i>New Game</i>. If not you will have to go in the console and type:

<p><b>devmap levelname </b>  (do not type in the file extension (.bsp)</p>

<p>Well this is it for Force Powers. Feel free to contact me if you need help getting any of this to work, or post a topic at the Massassi Forums in the <a href="http://forums.massassi.net/cgi-bin/forumdisplay.cgi?action=topics&forum=3.+Jedi+Outcast+Editing+Forum&number=17&DaysPrune=2&LastLogin=" target="_blank">Jedi Outcast Editing Forum</a>.</p>
