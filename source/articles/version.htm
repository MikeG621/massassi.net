<p><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font><span style="font-family: verdana"><font face="verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Some of you may have noticed that a lot of levels
are released to the general public that are chock full of bugs, and the authors know that
the bugs are there. You may be wondering why. Well I'm here to clear up this matter in a
summary I like to call </font><font face="verdana" size="2" color="red"><b>The Version
Conspiracy</b></font><font face="verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">.</font></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: verdana"><font face="verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One
of the biggest problems with levels today is that they are released too soon; in effect
creating a plethora of bug-ridden levels that you are unknowingly downloading. The cause
of this anomaly is the brute known as </font><b><font face="verdana" size="2" color="red">Version</font><font face="verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">!</b> He is a
ruthless killer of time and fun. He'll strike at any moment. He shows no mercy. He could
be lurking around the next corner...</font></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: verdana"><font face="verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who
could create such a vile, detestable creature? Would you believe it was </font><font face="verdana" size="2" color="red"><b>The Code Alliance</b></font><font face="verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">? The very group that makes these, and actually good, levels
possible! They added the </font><font face="verdana" size="2" color="red"><b>Version</b></font><font face="verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"> heading in the level authors text file. But The
Code Alliance did not knowingly create this menace to society. Quite the contrary; they
created it so authors could endlessly improve on their levels without having to do it all
at once. You could call them modern Dr. Frankensteins. But, once again, nature and it's
unpredictableness has spawned this weed that chokes the healthier crop of levels that were
painstakingly made by devoted authors everywhere.</font></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: verdana"><font face="verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font><font face="verdana" size="2" color="red"><b>Version</b></font><font face="verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"> is commonly found in readme files included with zips of levels and
cripples that level that had a chance to be something, and destroys authors that would
have otherwise made a name for themselves. It is disheartening to see these poor frail
levels hanging together with what strength they have, and their broken authors clinging to
what sanity they have left. I also feel for the people who live from day to day; wondering
when the next </font><font face="verdana" size="2" color="red"><b>version</b></font><font face="verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"> of a level will rear it's ugly head, posted on a JK
news site. Woe to you who are naive enough to persist in the pursuit of &quot;the next </font><font face="verdana" size="2" color="red"><b>version</b></font><font face="verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;.</font></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: verdana"><font face="verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To
you authors of bug-ridden levels; pull this thorn from our sides, and make sure that it
never returns. For if you do not heed the words of your victims; may you earn a name for
yourself that is so unholy I am almost afraid to speak it; you </font><b><font face="verdana" size="2" color="red">Versionaire</font><font face="verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">!</font></b></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: verdana"><font face="verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why
do people need these </font><font face="verdana" size="2" color="red"><b>versions</b></font><font face="verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">? It may be that people desire to improve upon
themselves and in that leave their creations flawed so they may improve it as they would
try to improve themselves. Every time they release a new </font><font face="verdana" size="2" color="red"><b>version</b></font><font face="verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">
in their minds they are improving upon themselves.</font></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: verdana"><font face="verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do
you think having </font><font face="verdana" size="2" color="red"><b>versions</b></font><font face="verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"> is worth it? Do the ends justify the means? That
decision is not yours or mine but the decision of the author. Choose wisely...</font></span></p>

someone desires information, they come to me.&quot; -</span></font><font size="2"> <a href="mailto:glitch@digisys.net">8t88</a></p>
