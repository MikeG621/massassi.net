    <tr>
        <td valign="top" rowspan="2" width="100%">All of this is
        taken from a survey done sometime around July/August if I
        remember correct. Although this is based on Quake since
        it's the only playable/modifiable true 3D-shooter as of
        today, all the ideas are valid for every other 3D
        first-person game.<br>
        First of all I'd like to thank all of you (16) that took
        your time to answer these questions. Even though we
        didn't get near as many replies as we were hoping for (50
        or so) we'll give you what facts we got. <br>
        The quotes included are all taken from the replies.<p><font color="#FF8000" size="4" face="Arial"><strong>Sniping/Camping</strong></font><font size="4" face="Arial"><strong><br>
        </strong></font>Most people felt that sniping was part of
        the game and couldn't be designed away. Camping is <strong>not</strong>
        the same thing as sniping, where sniping takes some skill
        and camping is based on plain luck and bad level design.
        One of sixteen thought that special sniping locations
        should be designed, others promoting sniping felt that
        snipers find places to snipe from anyway. Only one reply
        was specifically anti-sniper. <em>&quot;Another player
        should not be upset because he can't find the sniper,
        this is war...&quot;</em></p>
        <p><font color="#FF8000" size="4" face="Arial"><strong>Traps</strong></font><font size="4" face="Arial"><strong><br>
        </strong></font>A majority of the replies didn't want
        traps as part of the game, mostly because traps doesn't
        award frags to a player. Those who wanted traps wanted
        them to be designed as an obstacle when trying to get a
        powerful powerup or weapon. Narrow ledges above lava and
        such. <em>&quot;... the idea is to fight the players, not
        the map itself.&quot;</em></p>
        <p><font color="#FF8000" size="4" face="Arial"><strong>Lighting</strong></font><font size="4" face="Arial"><strong><br>
        </strong></font>This one is the hardest <strong>and</strong>
        the easiest to sum up; a well balanced mix of the both.
        Hmm... If I'm to extract anything from the replies to
        this question it's that most wanted a somewhat lit level,
        at least where the fighting takes place. Dark places is
        justifiable if not overdone. Almost no one wanted
        blinking/pulsating lights (only because of the slowdown
        in the engine). <em>&quot;... DM isn't really much fun if
        you can't ever see who you're shooting at.&quot;</em></p>
        <p><font color="#FF8000" size="4" face="Arial"><strong>Water</strong></font><font size="4" face="Arial"><strong><br>
        </strong></font>Nobody wanted big water areas. Water was
        ok if it fit into the look of the level itself or was
        used as a way of making it harder to get to the goodies.
        The major opinion was that it slows down game play. <em>&quot;The
        occasional pool of water that cleverly connects two rooms
        might be alright.&quot;</em></p>
        <p><font color="#FF8000" size="4" face="Arial"><strong>Weapons
        balance<br>
        </strong></font>Give me the rocket launcher! Only one out
        of sixteen felt that the RL was a bit to powerful in a DM
        level but admitted that it could be included if made hard
        to get to. Almost everyone wanted more than one RL,
        spread out through the level. Another few felt that all
        weapons should be represented more than once. This was
        linked with how big the level was though, with a bigger
        level needing more weapons of course. The majority of the
        replies wanted <strong>all</strong> weapons at least on
        one location. Those who uses the double barrel shotgun
        should be able to play the level even though I as the
        designer don't like that particular weapon.<em> &quot;2
        RL's would be nice, levels with only one RL are pretty
        lame...&quot;</em></p>
        <p><font color="#FF8000" size="4" face="Arial"><strong>Colosseum
        or the sewers<br>
        </strong></font>Another hard one to pinpoint an answer
        to. Again everyone wanted a healthy mix of both, not to
        cramped though. Some felt that arenas made it to easy to
        just fire an RL into any group of people and rack up the
        frags. If designing big areas, one would have to make
        sure that there's enough obstacles to promote some
        skills. The element of chasing another player down dark,
        winding corridors was appreciated by some but they felt
        that most of the time it boiled down to using the RL to
        clean out these corridors without to much effort...<em>
        &quot;Give the player some room to maneuver for Christ's
        sakes.&quot;</em></p>
        <p><font color="#FF8000" size="4" face="Arial"><strong>2
        or 32<br>
        </strong></font>Very target specific. To satisfy both 1
        on 1, LAN, Clan and Quakeworld battles is almost
        impossible. Design for a specific group and stick to it.<em>
        &quot;This is an intended-audience question.&quot;</em></p>
        <p><font color="#FF8000" size="4" face="Arial"><strong>Respawn
        points</strong></font><font size="4" face="Arial"><strong><br>
        </strong></font>Out of the way from snipers, not to far
        away from some minor upgrade (weapon or armor) and not
        directly in the heat of the battle. <em>&quot;If it's a
        crowded level, you would want to get stuff ASAP before
        you die.&quot;</em></p>
        <p><font color="#FF8000" size="4" face="Arial"><strong>Textures/environment<br>
        </strong></font>Once again we see two camps, one feeling
        that the environmental should be close to reality, thus
        making the player more immersed in the surroundings. The
        other side feels that a DM level should be designed for
        DM, even if it makes for some non-realistic designs.
        Everyone agreed on the fact that textures <strong>did</strong>
        matter. No matter how intelligent a level was designed,
        if its ugly, no one will play it. A coherent theme is
        very important, let it be space stations or medieval
        castles. Stick to it! Some pointed out the importance of
        using Quake's true 3D capabilities and the importance of
        designing in all directions. Don't overdo with doors that
        has to be opened or things sticking out from the walls,
        DM is about action. <em>&quot;Finally, good texture
        placement just looks good.&quot;</em></p>
        <p><font color="#FF8000" size="4" face="Arial"><strong>Powerups</strong></font><font size="4" face="Arial"><strong><br>
        </strong></font>Very dependant on level size, most felt
        that the really good stuff should be either very hard to
        get to or not included. A Quad is only useful if the
        other players has a way of getting on a somewhat equal
        level, say with a RL. If to many powerups are stored to
        close together or to close to respawn points the balance
        is lost. A lot felt that the Red Armor was to powerful as
        well as the Pentagram. Ring of Invisibility was another
        one that was to be used sparingly. Some felt that to much
        health was bad for gameplay and lead to people running
        away to heal up as soon as they got hit.<em> &quot;Quad
        is great when you have it, but sucks when your on the
        other end.&quot;</em></p>
        <p><font color="#FF8000" size="4" face="Arial"><strong>Wrapping
        it all up<br>
        </strong></font>Woah... I don't know if I can do it
        neatly. Even though we only got 16 replies, most of them
        were <strong>very</strong> enthusiastic, spanning several
        pages when printed, making it hard to summarize things. I
        was hoping on giving you some statistics but because of
        the nature of the replies it's almost impossible to turn
        them into numbers. If anyone is interested in seeing
        these replies, <a href="mailto:martin.edelius@spirex.se">let
        me know</a> and I'll forward them to you.<br>
        As mentioned, I'll see if I get the time designing a
        level with these suggestions implemented. If not, rest
        assured that I will use them in any of my other coming
        projects... ;)</p>
