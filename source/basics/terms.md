There are some essential terms you need to know while working with JK
levels.

**Sector** - A sector is basically a room made up of vertices, edges,
and surfaces.  

**Surface** - A surface is one side of a sector, a flat shape (like a
wall of a room), made up of vertices and edges.  

**Edge** - An edge is where two surfaces meet and is represented by a
line drawn between two vertices.  

**Vertex** - A vertex is a single point, like a period on this page,
that connects edges and makes angles possible.

Objects in red are defined below each image.
