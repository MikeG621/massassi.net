Sometimes you need to view your level from different angles to see what it 
looks like. To quickly switch views, you can press the keys 1 through 6. As far 
as I can tell, these are the views for the keys:  

<div class="cheat-table" markdown=1>

|         |          |
----------|-----------
1 - Top   | 4 - Bottom
2 - Front | 5 - Back
3 - Left  | 6 - Right

</div>

The grid is an innovative feature of JED, it controls along which plane
you move an object and can be complicated to use at best, but with a few
tips you'll master it in no time.  

**Shift + S** - Pressing Shift + S aligns the grid to the selected
object; be it a sector, surface, edge, vertex, thing, or light. This is
especially helpful while cleaving a surface.  

**Shift + 1 - 6** - Pressing Shift + a number 1 through 6 switches to
that view (see above) and aligns the grid to that view. This is useful
when you need to switch between different views to make sure you have
the right object selected.
