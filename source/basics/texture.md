Texturing is very simple once you get the hang of it. The overall look
and feel depends mostly on the editors' ability to texture the level in
an interesting, believable way. Enough said on that, now's the time to
actually texture something. First of all, go to the 3D preview, and
double click on a surface. This will allow you to choose a texture. With
that done, it will now show up. Sometimes, the texture will end up being
oriented funny, and you can change that. The following keys allow you to
manipulate the orientation of the texture:

|       keys        |  description                                                       |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| < >               | These keys allow you to move the texture right and left.           |
| [ctrl] + < >      | These keys allow you to rotate the texture.                        |
| [shift] + < >     | These keys allow you to move the texture up and down.              |
| [shift] + ?       | This key combination allows you to rotate the texture 180 degrees. |

Okay, now that you know how to add and orient a texture, we are going to
discuss a feature in Jed that puts Alexei Novikov, the programmer of
Jed, on par with a saint.  
  
This feature is called "texture stitching," and it allows you, with 2
keystrokes, to copy and orient textures. Instead of trying to explain
it, I will just tell you how to do it, and it will all come clear.
First, in 3D preview, click on a surface once. Then, press the semicolon
<kbd>;</kbd> key. Now, click on an adjoining surface, and press the apostrophe
<kbd>'</kbd> key. Now, you copied the original surface\! You can also use this
for textures that aren't touching, but a lot of the time, the texture
won't align correctly, so you have to do that manually. It is still a
lot faster than choosing textures each and every time.  
  
One last note on stitching, you don't have to keep going back and
hitting the <kbd>;</kbd> key on the original surface each time. All you have to
do is press <kbd>'</kbd> on each surface you want to have that texture.
