## Chat Room Rules

Please be courteous.  If you aren't, you may be kicked and banned.

## IRC

We use a service called Internet Relay Chat (IRC).  You can use any IRC client.  
Probably the most popular client on Windows is [mIRC](http://www.mirc.com/).

To connect, point your client to the server, port, and channel below.

## Chat Community

(this doesn't seem to be updated anymore but I'm leaving the link up since the site is still up)

Many folks who visit the site also hang out in the \#massassi channel
quite a bit. oSiRiS has put together a site dedicated to the channel
that offers statistics, user profiles, and a veritable treaure trove of
inside-joke material. Check it out at <http://chat.woggle.org>.
