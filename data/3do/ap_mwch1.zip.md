    A modern-day wood chair.  Would look good in any office, restaurant, house, etc. setting.  Detailed legs and armrests, well-textured, and perfectly scaled to fit Kyle (see screenshot).  Uses standard mats and the dflt.cmp colormap.  Version 2 chops the legs down to size so that Kyle's feet touch the floor, and completely re-textures it to look 100 percent better.  Note that Kyle is not included with the chair 3do, that's just Kyle placed in the chair in the screenshot.
