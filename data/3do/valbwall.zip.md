    This is a wall with a hole for shooting though and a fence for seeing through. The fence will guard you while the hole below it is in just the right height for your gun. I'll warn that I don't know how to make the fence part see-through in software mode, and I doubt there is a way, so prepare for software users to find it useless. It's good for defense, especially in a CTF level, for instance.
